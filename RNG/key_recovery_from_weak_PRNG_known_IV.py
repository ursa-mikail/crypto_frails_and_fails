üß† Attack Summary
A system uses rand() (weak PRNG) to generate both the AES key and IV.

Attacker knows the IV (it‚Äôs sent with the ciphertext) and some structure of the plaintext (like b"LOGIN=").

Brute-force the PRNG seed to recreate both the IV and key, verifying the correct one by decrypting the ciphertext and checking the prefix.

üîê Why This Is Dangerous
Many devices and libraries have used predictable seeds like time(NULL), PIDs, or MAC addresses.

The IV is often sent in plaintext, so if the attacker sees it and knows the plaintext structure, the seed is practically leaked.

Once the seed is recovered, the full AES key is exposed.

üîí Real-World Lessons
Always use secrets.token_bytes() or os.urandom() for secure key/IV generation.

Never use predictable sources (time, PID, etc.) as RNG seeds.

CBC is malleable ‚Äî combining that with weak RNGs opens the door to full plaintext/key recovery.
