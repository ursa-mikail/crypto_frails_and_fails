"""
ðŸ§¨ Vulnerabilities Illustrated:
Fixed Seed: Makes all PRNG outputs predictable after reset.
Low Entropy or Uninitialized Seed: Makes brute-forcing feasible.
No Entropy Health Check: Could easily use low-quality or reused entropy.
State Recovery: Even if only partial output is leaked, internal state can often be recovered due to LCG reversibility.
